# Hi I'm Anita

I'm a Ph.D. in statistics with a strong focus on active learning, adaptive designs, and statistical modelling and working with high-performance computing (HPC) systems. I’m also passionate about improving computational efficiency and model accuracy. Currently, I’m working on projects related to computer experiments, while deepening my knowledge of Bayesian statistics and machine learning techniques through various online resources.
